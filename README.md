# FAIR Data Station

*FAIR Data Station API*

## Usage

The recommended use is with Docker and Docker Compose and configuration via environment variables:

```yml
  fds:
    image: fairdata/fairdatastation:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    # ports:
    #   - 127.0.0.1:8080:8080
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    # volumes:
    #   - ${PROJECT_ROOT}/application.fds.yml:/app/application.yml:ro
    environment:
      FDS_FDP_URL: http://fdp-client
      FDS_POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}
      FDS_POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      FDS_POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      # FHIR endpoint (for FHIR Trains)
      FDS_FHIR_BASE_URL: ${FHIR_API_BASE}
      # Triple Store (for SPARQL Trains)
      FDS_TRIPLE_STORE_TYPE: 4
      FDS_TRIPLE_STORE_URL: ${GRAPHDB_URL}
      FDS_TRIPLE_STORE_REPOSITORY: ${GRAPHDB_DATA_REPO}
      FDS_TRIPLE_STORE_USERNAME: ${GRAPHDB_USERNAME}
      FDS_TRIPLE_STORE_PASSWORD: ${GRAPHDB_PASSWORD}
```

## Development

For development, we highly recommend using IDE and run Maven commands or the Spring Boot application from it.

### Technology Stack

- **Java** (JDK 17)
- **PostgreSQL DB** (13 or higher)
- **Maven** (3.6 or higher)
- **Docker** (20.10 or higher) - *for building Docker image only*

### Build & Run

To run the application, a PostgreSQL DB is required to be running. To configure the standard connection
suitable for development (`postgresql://localhost/fds`), simply instruct Spring Boot to use the `dev` profile:

```bash
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

Alternatively, create an `application.yml` file  (or edit appropriate one) in the project root, and then run:

```bash
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Run tests

Run from the root of the project:

```bash
$ mvn test
```

### Package the application

Run from the root of the project:

```bash
$ mvn package
```

### Create a Docker image

Run from the root of the project (requires building `jar` file using `mvn package` as shown above):

```bash
$ docker build -t fairdatastation:local .
```

Note: Supplied [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) is multistage and as such does not require Java nor Maven to be
installed directly.
